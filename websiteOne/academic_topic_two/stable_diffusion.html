                <h2>Stable Diffusion</h2>
                <p>Stable Diffusion is a new technique that uses advanced machine learning models to create images from text.
                    This technology is developed by StabilityAI, a company that specializes in AI research and development. Essentially,
                    you input a text prompt and Stable Diffusion will generate an image based on the text. This technology is still being
                    developed but the pace of new models and tools developed for it has been increasing rapidly.

                <h2>Current Generation and Open Sourced Development</h2>
                <p> Currently, Stable Diffusion has multiple base models ranging from 1.0, 2.0 and SDXL. However, there has been hundreds or
                    thousands of models that have been developed by the community from these base models. Most of them are trained by the community and are open sourced
                    for anyone to use. They have also developed tools to make it easier to train models and generate images such as Automatic111\'s
                    webUI tool, Kohya_ss and more. 
                </p>

                <h2>ControlNet</h2>
                <p>
                    ControlNet is a powerful addon to Stable Diffusion that allows you to control the image generation process. A user can input images to 
                    the model and it will generate images that are similar to the input images. This is useful for artists who want to generate images
                    based on sketches or images that they want to use as a reference.
