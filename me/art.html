        I haven't drawn much lately but creating art is something that I wish I could do for the rest of my life. I have been creating art
        <br>
        since I was a kid and I have been drawing digitally since ~2018.

        Here is my artstation if you want to check out some of my works:

    <h2>
        AI Art Concerns
    </h2>
    <p>
        Having some coding background, I am interested in new developments in AI that could help artists better express their
        ideas like
        <br>
        Stable Diffusion. I have trained a couple of loRAs myself and I am excited to see what the future holds for AI art. I do
        understand
        <br>
        the concerns of AI taking over the jobs of artists but I believe that AI is just a tool and not a replacement for the
        creative minds behind the art.
