                <h2>Impacts</h2>
                <p> The impact of AI has been rapidly increasing for the past few years. From text transformers to image generation, AI has been
                    used in many different fields. All of the jobs that are being threatened has one thing in common. They are white collar jobs that were 
                    once thought to be safe from automation. However, with the rapid development of AI, these jobs are now going to be automated and 
                    replaced by AI.

                <h2>CopyRight</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest concerns of AI is the issue of copy right. The stable diffusion models that are used to generate images are trained on images that are
                    scraped from the internet. This means that the images that are generated are based on images that are already copy righted and used without
                    permission. The supreme court has ruled that AI works cannot be copy righted but clarified that if a user has transformed it enough, it can be
                    copy righted. Even though we are in a legal limbo of sorts, the court of public opinion is clear. AI is seen as a threat to artists and the use of it
                    is greatly frowned upon.
